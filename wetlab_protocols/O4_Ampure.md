# Optional Protocol 4 - Ampure XP amplicon clean up

## Theory
If significant primer dimer formation has occured, these will be quantified by the picogreen assay and lead to poor normalization. If >=25 cycles of PCR have been run during primary PCR, or if during QC, significant primer dimers are observed then this protocol is recommended. Depending on the ratio of beads to DNA volume, a size selection is possible which will remove small DNA. This protocol is set up to use a 1.8x volume; however, this can be adjusted in the script. The defaults in the script will assume you have 50ul amplicon to clean up and will use 90ul beads (1.8x).

## Note
When making fresh 70% ethanol, do not add ethanol and fill the rest of the volume with water because this will lead to the incorrect ethanol percentage. Instead, add 70 mL of ethanol and 30 mL of water for a total volume of 100 mL of 70% ethanol.

### Protocol
- [ ] Prepare fresh 70% ethanol and put in columns 2 and 3 of the 12 well reservoir.
- [ ] Add appropriate volume of beads to well 1 and ensure they are well mixed (bead volume/sample * Nsamples * 1.2)
- [ ] Add appropriate volume of water to well 4 (elution volume * Nsamples * 1.2)
- [ ] Set up OT2 according to Figure 1 below.
- [ ] Obtain a copy of scripts/O4_AmpureXPWash.py
- [ ] Modify lines 15-28 as required with close attention to desired bead volumes and elution volumes.
- [ ] Calibrate all deck positions and run method. **Estimated run time X min**
- [ ] After execution dispose of waste and clean out tip container
